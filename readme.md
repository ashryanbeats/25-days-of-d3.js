# 25 Days of D3.js

A quick and dirty browser-based implementation of exercises found in Tyler Wolf's excellent [_25 Days of D3.js_](https://medium.com/@tylernwolf/25-days-of-d3-js-de5419874e79) course.

The lessons are hosted on Observable. I started making this repo because, in their own words, [Observableâ€™s not JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript), and I found myself almost immediately wondering what these lessons might look like in vanilla JavaScript.

(I'm not committing to 100% completion of this repo, but figured I'd share what I do implement. Feel free to fork and submit pull requests.)

## Setup

Clone the repo, then:

```shell
npm i
npm start
```

Then point your browser to `localhost:8080`.
